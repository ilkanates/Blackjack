# Blackjack Game

This is a simple implementation of the Blackjack card game in Python. The program allows a player to play a game of Blackjack against a dealer. The game uses a standard 52-card deck, with card values determined by the classic game rules.

## How to play

1. Run the `blackjack()` function to start a new game.
2. The player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.
3. The player can then choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
4. If the player's hand exceeds 21 points, they lose the game.
5. If the player's hand is 21 points or less, the dealer's turn begins.
6. The dealer will continue to take cards until their hand exceeds 16 points.
7. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21 points, the player wins the game.
8. If the dealer's hand is between 17 and 21 points, the player's hand is compared to the dealer's hand, and the higher hand wins.
9. If the player's hand is equal to the dealer's hand, the game is a draw.

## How to run

2. Clone or download the repository
3. Open the command line or terminal and navigate to the project directory
4. Run the command `python blackjack.py` to start the game
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game
